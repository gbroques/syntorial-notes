## Lesson 1: On Your Own
1. Initialize
    * Does your synth initialize with a preset? No.
    * Is there a reset button? No.
    * Does it load in an initialized state with just a plain waveform? Yes.
2. What waveforms does your synth offer?
    * Sine
    * Triangle
    * **Pulse**
    * Saw (Triangle)
    * Power (**Saw**)
    * Gauss
    * Diode
    * Abssine
    * Pulsesine
    * Stretchsine
    * Chip
    * Absstretchsine
    * Chebyshev
    * Sqr
    * Spike
    * Circle
3. How does your synth implement pulse width?
    * Underneath where you select the waveform you can adjust the "**SHAPE**" of the waveform.
    * When PULSE is selected, moving SHAPE to the left decreases the length of the bottom while increasing the top. Conversely, moving SHAPE to the right does the opposite.
    * When SHAPE is in the center, the default state, the waveform is **square**.
